# OccipitalCandy_dMRIpipeline

## Summary 

I would like to create a pipeline to combine different aspects of diffusion processing in a way that can be shared easily across labs, with reproducibilty being a primary concern.

## Project definition 

### Background

### Tools 

For this project, I will concentrate on gaining competencies in the following general areas using the following tools:

  * Datasharing, Open Science
      * BIDS (e.g. Pybids)
      * Github
      * Docker or Singularity
      
  * Streamlining and combining pipelines for multimodal MRI data pre-processing and analysis 
      * Integration (wrapping) of other processing programs to be called within python (e.g. FSL, CAT12, ComBat)
      * Python (pandas, NumPy , DyPy, etc.) 
      * Parallelization (Nextflow)
      
  * Standaridized visualization pipeline for easy comparison across groups
      * matplotlib  

### Data

Previously collected, preprocessed and analyzed structural and diffusion MRI data will provide the base test dataset to ensure the proper functining of the proprosed scripts.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, workinig scripts will have been developed, allowing for the processing, anaylsis and visulazation of multi-site sMRI and dMRI datasets in a colloberative evironment.
